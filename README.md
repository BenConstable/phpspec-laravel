## Versions

Depending on the version of Laravel and/or Phpspec you're using, you'll want to make sure that
you're using the version of this package that's right for you. Use the table below to pick
the right one.

**Note:** Phpspec `v3.0` support is currently in development on the `master` branch.

| Package Version | Laravel Version | Phpspec Version |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `^v1.2`         | `^v4.1`         | `^v2.0`         |
| `^v2.0`         | `^v5.0`         | `^v2.1`         |
| `^v3.0@dev`     | `^v5.0`         | `^v3.0`         |
 
## Installation

Add this to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "benconstable/phpspec-laravel": "~3.0@dev"
    }
}
```

then add this to your `phpspec.yml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  PhpSpec\Laravel\Extension\LaravelExtension: ~
```

You can take a look at [`example.phpspec.yml`](https://github.com/BenConstable/phpspec-laravel/blob/master/example.phpspec.yml)
for a good set of sensible phpspec defaults for a Laravel project.

## Why this extension?

This extension provides you with a bootstrapped Laravel environment when writing
your phpspec tests.

It allows you to make use of some of the nice features that Laravel provides, like
[class aliases](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/config/app.php#L161)
and [helper functions](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/helpers), without being
hindered by your testing framework.

This extension **is not** a swap-in replacement for Laravel's built in PHPUnit setup.
If you'd like integration and/or functional tests, please use that,
[Behat](http://behat.org/), or [Codeception](http://codeception.com/).

## Configuration

### Testing environment

By default, the extension bootstraps Laravel in the `testing` environment. You
can change this to production (or whatever you like) by setting:

```yaml
extensions:
  PhpSpec\Laravel\Extension\LaravelExtension:
    testing_environment: "production"
```

in your `phpspec.yml`.

### App bootstrap path

By default, the extension will bootstrap your app by looking for `bootstrap/app.php`
in the directory above `vendor/`. This is the default location that Laravel
provides.

You can manually specify the path to the bootstrap file if you're using a non-standard
installation, like so:

```yaml
extensions:
  PhpSpec\Laravel\Extension\LaravelExtension:
    framework_path: "/non/standard/laravel/setup/app.php"
```

You can specify either an absolute path (use leading slash), or a path relative
to the `vendor/` directory.

## Usage

### Testing without Laravel

If you're not using any code specific to the Laravel environment, then you don't
need to do anything differently. Just write your phpspec tests as normal!

### Testing with Laravel

If you want to take advantage of Laravel's aliases, or use some of its
[helper functions](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/helpers), extend your specs
from `PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior`. This will prevent errors when
testing.

**For example, this class uses an alias:**

```php
<?php
namespace App;

use Inspiring;

class MyInspiring extends Inspiring
{
    public function quoteBackwards()
    {
        return strrev(parent::quote());
    }
}
```

and without extending from `PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior`:

```php
<?php
namespace spec\App;

use PhpSpec\ObjectBehavior;

class MyInspiringSpec extends ObjectBehavior
{
    function it_inspires_backwards()
    {
        $this->quoteBackwards()->shouldBeString();
    }
}
```

you'll get `Fatal error: Class 'Inspiring' not found...`. But extending from `PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior`:

```php
<?php
namespace spec\App;

use PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior;

class MyInspiringSpec extends LaravelObjectBehavior
{
    function it_inspires_backwards()
    {
        $this->quoteBackwards()->shouldBeString();
    }
}
```

you'll get `✔ inspires backwards`.

**and this class uses a helper function:**

```php
<?php
namespace App;

class MyEncryptor
{
    public function encrypt($arg)
    {
        return bcrypt($arg);
    }
}
```

and without extending from `PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior`:

```php
<?php
namespace spec\App;

use PhpSpec\ObjectBehavior;

class MyEncryptor extends ObjectBehavior
{
    function it_encrypts_a_string()
    {
        $this->encrypt()->shouldBeString();
    }
}
```

you'll get `Fatal error: Call to a member function make() on a non-object...`.
But extending from `PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior`:

```php
<?php
namespace spec\App;

use PhpSpec\Laravel\LaravelObjectBehavior;

class MyEncryptor extends LaravelObjectBehavior
{
    function it_encrypts_a_string()
    {
        $this->encrypt()->shouldBeString();
    }
}
```

you'll get `✔ encrypts a string`.

### Accessing the IoC container

If you need to access the [Service Container](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/container)
in your specs, just use the `app()` helper!

## Learning more about phpspec and Laravel

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) has some great guides on phpspec and Laravel.
['Laravel, phpspec and refactoring'](https://laracasts.com/lessons/phpspec-laravel-and-refactoring)
is a good starting point; it shows how you should use phpspec with Laravel,
and covers the basics of writing tests (and it's free!).
